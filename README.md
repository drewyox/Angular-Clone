# Super Galactic Age Calculator

#### This website is a recreation of the Etsy homepage, created for an exercise of understanding the Angular superset. 

#### By **Drew Yoxsimer**

## Description

This is the beginning of a clone of the Etsy crafting site. Right now it consists of mostly just html and css to mark out and map the site. However, these css and html files are divided into separate components. Each component houses a small amount of html and css and is passed back up the chain to the root component.

### Planned Features

# _Shopping and Latest Components_
  * Both of these components feature bits of css and html that are essentially repeated spare the content within them. I hope to write a ts class to duplicate them with less code.  
# _Missing Components_
  * I am going to add the remaining components that map out the homepage in its entirety before the next Friday project period in hopes that I can add more actual funtionality and interactivity to the site itself.



## Known Bugs
* No known bugs at this time.
